Homework 4 - Gauss-Jordan Elimination / Dynamic Programming

README:

This document provides a brief description of two programs: GaussJordanElimination and MostPreciousPath.

Program 1: GaussJordanElimination
This program implements the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm to solve a system of linear equations.
The program receives a square matrix A and a vector b as inputs and outputs the solution vector x.

Usage:

Define the matrix A and the vector b in the main method of the class.
Run the program, and it will display the input matrix A, the vector b, and the solution vector x.

Program 2: MostPreciousPath
This program helps Bilbo Baggins find the most precious path through a room filled with gems.
The program receives a 2D array representing the room as input, where each cell contains a gem count.
Bilbo can only move up, up-left, or up-right. The program outputs the starting square,
the path Bilbo should take, the total number of gems collected, and the vault number containing the Arkenstone.

Usage:

Define the 2D array (room) in the main method of the class.
Run the program, and it will display the starting square, the path, the total number of gems collected,
and the vault number containing the Arkenstone.
Please note that both programs have sample inputs already defined in the main methods.
You can replace these inputs with your own data to test the programs with different scenarios.
